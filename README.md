•	Import Data:
-	After connecting to the MySQL database, select the tables or views you want to import into Power BI.

•	Data Transformation:
-	Power BI provides tools to clean and transform the imported data.
-	Use the "Transform Data" option to perform operations such as filtering, renaming columns, removing duplicates, etc.

•	Create Relationships: Data Modelling.
-	If you have multiple tables, establish relationships between them based on common fields. This allows you to create more complex visualizations and analysis.

•	Design Dashboard:
-	Once your data is imported and transformed, start designing your dashboard.
-	Add visualizations such as charts, graphs, tables, and maps to represent your data.
-	Arrange the visualizations on different pages within your report to create a cohesive dashboard experience.

•	Apply Filters and Slicers:
-	Use filters and slicers to allow users to interact with the data dynamically.
-	Filters enable users to focus on specific subsets of data, while slicers provide a visual way to filter data across multiple visualizations simultaneously.

•	Add Calculated Columns and Measures:
-	Create calculated columns and measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to perform calculations on your data.
-	Calculated columns are computed based on data in a single row, while measures are aggregated calculations across multiple rows.

•	Format and Customize:
-	Customize the appearance of your dashboard by adjusting colors, fonts, and styles to match your preferences or corporate branding.

•	Publish Dashboard:
-	Once your dashboard is complete, publish it to the Power BI Service (Power BI cloud platform) so that others can access it.

•	Share and Collaborate:
-	Share the published dashboard with colleagues or stakeholders by granting them access to the workspace.
